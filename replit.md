## User Preferences
- **Deployment**: User prefers Docker-based deployment for easy setup
- **Platform**: Ubuntu compatibility required for both development and production
- **Production Ready**: Requires separate production configuration with security
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with database schema details
- **Simplicity**: Focus on one-command setup and clear instructions
- **Environment**: Prefer environment variables over hardcoded configuration
- **Security**: Production deployment must have proper security measures
- **Cross-Platform**: Must work on default development and specific production environments

## Technical Decisions
- **Dual Environment**: Separate development and production configurations
- **Docker First**: Prioritized Docker setup for consistent deployment
- **Environment Variables**: All configuration through .env files

2. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` for local development
3. **Docker Development**: `docker compose up -d` for containerized deployment
4. **Database**: `npm run db:push` for schema updates
5. **Testing**: Default credentials testuser/password123

## Production Workflow
1. **Production Setup**: `cp .env.production .env.production.local` and customize
2. **Production Deployment**: `./deploy-production.sh` for automated deployment
3. **Production Docker**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`
4. **SSL Configuration**: Configure certificates and domain
5. **Monitoring**: Use production logging and health checks

## Next Steps
- Restore full routes.ts functionality with all advanced features
