To implement a smart, suggestion-based commodity selector (autocomplete/dropdown) in your Replit-based TradeWiser app with bilingual (English + Hindi) commodity names and persist them in the system:

‚úÖ What You Want:
Predefined standard commodity list ‚Äì grains, pulses, spices, seeds, cotton, etc.

Autocomplete/suggestion dropdown on the "Commodity Name" field.

Display both English and Hindi names (e.g., Wheat (‡§ó‡•á‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç)).

Long-term persistence, so the list is not lost on logout.

Clean, scalable code structure that can expand to new categories later.

# TASK: Add a smart commodity selector to the TradeWiser app with bilingual autocomplete suggestions.

# ‚úÖ Requirements:
# 1. Use a structured commodity list with both English and Hindi names.
# 2. Implement a suggestion-based autocomplete component for "Commodity Name".
# 3. Format dropdown items as: "Wheat (‡§ó‡•á‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç)", "Moong (‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§ó)", etc.
# 4. Add a fallback if the commodity is not listed (free text allowed).
# 5. The commodity list must persist (hardcoded JSON or stored in DB, not session-based).
# 6. Categories: Grains, Pulses, Spices, Seeds, Fibres.
# 7. Add commonly traded long-shelf-life agri commodities like cotton, soyabean, castor, mustard, etc.

# ‚úÖ Suggested Data Structure:
commodities = [
    {"category": "Grains", "english": "Wheat", "hindi": "Gehu"},
    {"category": "Grains", "english": "Rice", "hindi": "Chawal"},
    {"category": "Pulses", "english": "Moong", "hindi": "Moong"},
    {"category": "Spices", "english": "Cardamom", "hindi": "Elachi"},
    {"category": "Fibres", "english": "Cotton", "hindi": "Rui"},
    {"category": "Seeds", "english": "Mustard Seed", "hindi": "Sarson"},
    # Add more from the Excel provided...
]

# ‚úÖ UI Logic:
# - Use a select input or searchable dropdown (e.g., React Select with filtering).
# - Show suggestions as user types: match against both English and Hindi names.
# - Upon selection, populate the Commodity Name field with the value: "Wheat (Gehu)".
# - Optional: store separate values internally (e.g., english_name + hindi_name).

# ‚úÖ Storage:
# - Store the commodity list in a `commodities.json` file or DB collection.
# - On app load, load this list into the selector component.
# - Ensure this is not tied to session/login/logout (i.e., globally available).

# ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements:
# - Add filtering by Category: dropdown to first select ‚ÄúGrains‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpices‚Äù, etc.
# - Add icons/colors per category if needed later.
