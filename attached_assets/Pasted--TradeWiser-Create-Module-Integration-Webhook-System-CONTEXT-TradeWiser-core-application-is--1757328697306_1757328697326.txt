# TradeWiser: Create Module Integration & Webhook System

CONTEXT: TradeWiser core application is working perfectly. Now implement webhook system for seamless integration with external warehousing and quality testing modules.

OBJECTIVE: Create comprehensive API integration system for real-time communication between TradeWiser and external modules.

## WEBHOOK ENDPOINTS TO CREATE:

### 1. Warehouse Status Updates
Endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/warehouse/status-update
Purpose: Receive real-time updates from warehouse management module

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Accept webhook calls from warehouse module
- Update process status in database (processes table)
- Emit WebSocket updates to frontend for real-time UI updates
- Handle all 9 deposit workflow stages
- Update commodity status and location data

### 2. IoT Weight & Quality Data  
Endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/warehouse/weight-update
Purpose: Receive IoT weighbridge data and quality assessment results

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Process weight measurements from IoT devices
- Update commodity quantities based on actual measurements
- Trigger automatic receipt generation when quality assessment complete
- Update valuation based on final weight and grade

### 3. Quality Testing Results
Endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/quality/results  
Purpose: Receive AI-powered quality assessment results

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Save quality assessment data to database
- Update commodity grade and market valuation
- Trigger automatic receipt generation if quality meets standards
- Send notifications to user about quality results

## OUTBOUND API SYSTEM:

### 1. Send to Warehouse Module
Function: sendToWarehouseModule()
Purpose: Send new deposits to warehouse for processing

FEATURES:
- Send commodity details when deposit created
- Include farmer information and pickup preferences  
- Handle API authentication with warehouse module
- Retry mechanism for failed requests
- Error logging and monitoring

### 2. Request Quality Testing
Function: requestQualityTesting()  
Purpose: Trigger AI quality assessment

FEATURES:
- Send commodity samples for AI analysis
- Include commodity type and expected parameters
- Handle quality module authentication
- Track testing status and results

## REAL-TIME UPDATES:

### WebSocket Integration
- Use existing WebSocket infrastructure (ws package)
- Emit status updates to connected clients
- Update dashboard values in real-time
- Show live process tracking for deposits

### Database Triggers
- Auto-generate receipts when quality+weight confirmed
- Update portfolio values when new data received
- Create audit trails for all external data updates

## API AUTHENTICATION:

### Security Implementation
- API key authentication for webhook endpoints
- Request signature verification for data integrity
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- IP whitelist for trusted warehouse/quality modules

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
Add these to .env configuration:
