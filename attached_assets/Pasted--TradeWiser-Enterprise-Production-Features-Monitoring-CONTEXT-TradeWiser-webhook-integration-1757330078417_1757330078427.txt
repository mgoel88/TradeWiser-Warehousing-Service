# TradeWiser: Enterprise Production Features & Monitoring

CONTEXT: TradeWiser webhook integration system is working perfectly. Add enterprise-grade monitoring, error handling, documentation, and production features.

OBJECTIVE: Enhance the integration system with comprehensive monitoring, retry mechanisms, API documentation, and production-ready features.

## ENTERPRISE MONITORING SYSTEM:

### 1. Integration Health Dashboard (/admin/integration-health)
Create comprehensive monitoring interface:

FEATURES:
- Real-time webhook success/failure rates  
- API response time monitoring
- External module connectivity status
- Error rate tracking and alerts
- WebSocket connection statistics
- Database performance metrics

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Track all webhook calls with timestamps
- Monitor outbound API call latencies  
- Display connection health for warehouse/quality modules
- Show real-time error logs with filtering
- Export metrics for external monitoring tools

### 2. Advanced Error Handling & Recovery

RETRY MECHANISMS:
- Exponential backoff for failed outbound API calls
- Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing
- Automatic retry for transient failures (3 attempts max)
- Circuit breaker pattern for external module failures

ERROR TRACKING:
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- Error categorization (network, validation, business logic)
- Alert system for critical integration failures
- Error recovery workflows and notifications

### 3. API Documentation Generator

AUTO-GENERATED DOCS:
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all webhook endpoints
- Interactive API testing interface (Swagger UI)
- Code examples for external module developers
- Webhook payload schemas with validation rules

DEVELOPER RESOURCES:
- Integration testing guides
- Webhook signature verification examples  
- Error response documentation
- Rate limiting and authentication guides

## PRODUCTION RELIABILITY FEATURES:

### 1. Advanced Security Enhancements

SECURITY HARDENING:
- Rate limiting per API key (100 requests/minute)
- Request size limits and payload validation
- IP whitelisting for production environments
- Audit logging for all authentication attempts

MONITORING:
- Track API key usage patterns
- Alert on suspicious activity or failed authentications
- Log all webhook signatures for security auditing

### 2. Performance Optimization

CACHING LAYER:
- Redis cache for frequently accessed data
- Smart caching of portfolio calculations
- Cache invalidation on webhook updates

DATABASE OPTIMIZATION:
- Query optimization for real-time updates
- Database connection pooling
- Index optimization for webhook queries

### 3. Business Intelligence Features

ANALYTICS DASHBOARD:
- Integration usage statistics
- Processing time analytics by commodity type
- Quality assessment success rates  
- Warehouse throughput metrics
- Financial impact tracking (portfolio value changes)

REPORTING:
- Daily/weekly integration summary reports
- Performance trend analysis
- Cost analysis per integration call
- Business metrics extraction

## EXTERNAL MODULE DOCUMENTATION:

### 1. WMS Integration Guide (docs/wms-integration.md)
