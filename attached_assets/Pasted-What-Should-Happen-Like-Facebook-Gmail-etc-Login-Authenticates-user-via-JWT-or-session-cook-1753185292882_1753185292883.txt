What Should Happen (Like Facebook, Gmail, etc.)
🔒 Login:
Authenticates user via JWT or session cookie.

Loads user-specific data (dashboard, history, warehousing receipts, etc.) from backend or cached storage.

🔓 Logout:
Only destroys session or token.

User data remains intact in the database.

Frontend should clear auth state, but user info may remain in memory or localStorage for UX (e.g., showing "Welcome back" after next login).

Redirects back to a landing/companion site, not a blank login page.

❌ What Should NOT Happen:
Logging out must not delete user profile, receipts, stored metadata, or uploaded receipts.

Backend must not clear DB entries on logout.

Frontend must not wipe persistent identifiers unless instructed.

✅ Updated Prompt to Replit Agent
Here’s a bulletproof prompt you can send:

👋 Hey! I’m building TradeWiser, a warehousing-as-a-service app (like Uber for agri commodities).

I need your help to fix the login/logout + data persistence logic. Please follow this strictly:

🔄 Expected Behavior:
1. Persistent User Data:

User data (profile, uploaded receipts, inspection history, storage balances) must be stored permanently in the database.

Logging out should not delete any of this.

Please ensure the logout function only clears the session/token and not any stored data.

2. Session Persistence:

Login should create a secure session (JWT in localStorage or HttpOnly cookie).

On page refresh, user should remain logged in unless token expires or is invalidated.

3. Companion Site Flow:

I’ve built a companion landing page with info + login.

After logout, the user should be redirected to this landing page (/home or /landing).

Not just dumped on the login screen.

4. Frontend Handling:

Frontend should clear the session token on logout.

But if helpful for UX, you may keep non-sensitive user data (like username or ID) in localStorage for personalized messaging.

🛠️ What to Fix:
Update the logout controller so it does not modify or delete any user or receipt data.

Ensure login persists session securely.

Add redirect to the landing/companion page on logout.

Keep user data safe, persistent, and untouched on logout.

Let me know if anything is unclear. Thanks!
